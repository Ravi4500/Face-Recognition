# Face-Recognition
A basic Face recognition model

Model is built using python libraries like Face_recognition,opencv,numpy.

Path variable have a folder called "Advancedimages" which contains photos(.jpg format) to be trained.

In my code for a path variable i just gave folder name because that folder was in current working directory, otherwise make sure to give path of folder.

Firstly faces which are in folders are encoded and through webcam it will capture image/video which is to be recognised and recognises the face if encdings are matched.
